# No Me Baño Soulbound Graffiti Token

This project used soulbound tokens to "graffiti" the wallets of 23 Ethereum Argentina attendees to commemorate the conference and promote their NFT collection 
23  dias sin lavarme available on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/es/collection/moskas-238).

Soulbound tokens were chosen because like graffiti / street art they have not monetary value because they cannot be bought or sold. They can only be removed / destroyed.

No Me Baño is a street art collective based in Buenos Aires.
